# Price prediction models

**created and compared betweena different models in irder to predict the price of a mobile phone based on its features**

- Models used:
    1) Linear Regression
    2) Random Forest
    3) Gradient Boosting
    4) SVM
    5) KNN

the models can be found in `Models.ipynb` file

## Data preprocessing

- performed data cleaning by removing all the nan vlaues ensuring the it will not affect the model performance
- the file can be found in `dataProcessing.ipynb`

### EDA

- performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data and its distribution
- visualized the data using seaborn and matplotlib
- checked the correlation between the features
- plots used:
    1) Histogram
    2) Boxplot
    3) heatmap
